        <h1>FUN FACT</h1>
        <p>Did you know that M. Night Shamylan is one of the best directors of all time? No? Are you kidding? I mean, yeah, Signs wasn't that good. But hey! The Visit was pretty neat. :D</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>  
    <p>SPLIT by M. Night Shamylan is an epic thriller based around the mind of a man with Multiple Personality Disorder. This man kidnaps three teenagers and keeps them as &quot;offerings&quot; for the Beast.</p>
   
    <h2>The Misconception</h2>
    <p>  Many complain that SPLIT served as an offensive piece that insulted the mentally ill. However, this is most definitely not the case. There is overwhelming amount of respect for the mentally ill in this film. During the movie, our kidnapper - who serves as a sort-of protagonist - speaks frequently to his psychologist. That psychologist has a mission of sorts - to study why people with MPD think the way they do, and how each of their personalities should be <i>acknowledged</i>. She gives lectures, freaking <i>lectures</i>, about this topic. Additionally, the psychologist pitches her idea to her coworkers, stating that all mentally ill patients need to be recognized.</p>
    
    <p>So don't worry, people. M. Night Shamylan understands ya'll loud and clear. Now it's time to inspect the good stuff! </p>
    
    <h3>The Characters</h3>
    <p>I stated earlier that the kidnapper serves as the protagonist somewhat in the film. Well, the reason why is because the rest of the characters are pure <b>cardboard.</b> I know that we are supposed to feel bad for the girls who are kidnapped and wish that they survive in the end. But the antagonist is <em>too much fun!</em> His quirky personalities practically <i>steal</i> the show. You'll often find yourself wanting him to stay on screen, just to see what crazy shit he can do next! I admit, the psychologist herself is unique too. Her open-mindedness about mental health (and mental ability) really helps bring out the story a bit more.&nbsp;5/10&#40;only for the bad guy!&#41;</p>
    
    <h3>The Setting</h3>
    <p>Everything is contained within a closed space, so the suspense really works here. Seeing the characters run out of options is very fulfilling. The antagonist keeps the main cast on their toes - brining them &#40;and the audience&#41; to an extreme panic. Having an open space makes the &quot;horror&quot; less effecient. I'm glad that Shamylan keeps all action contained. Additionally, the scenery surrounding the psychologist's office was unique too. It provided a "safe space" for our antagonist, and revealed the multiple personalities one by one.&nbsp;8/10</p>
    
    
    <h3>The Effects</h3>
    <p>The only thing I can say about the effects is <i>job well done</i>! Shamylan knows his stuff for sure. All the lighting, transformations, audio and visual cues are on point. </p>
